A fairly simple Tarot plugin.  Generates a three-card spread in a Gutenberg Block.

posts!  You can then write an interpretation for the spread or do whatever you like with the results.


== Upcoming Changes ==

* The ability to download and use alternate deck images
* The ability to manually select the cards, rather than using the computer to generate the selections
* More spreads / layouts
