A fairly simple Tarot plugin.  Generates a three-card spread in a Gutenberg Block.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a new block in the Gutenberg editor, letting you generate and display Tarot spreads in your
posts!  You can then write an interpretation for the spread or do whatever you like with the results.

The bundled black and white SVG card images are generated from the 1910 Rider-Waite deck, which is in the public domain.

== Upcoming Changes ==

* The ability to download and use alternate deck images
* The ability to manually select the cards, rather than using the computer to generate the selections
* More spreads / layouts

== Changelog ==

= 0.9.1 =
* Add ability to download and use 8bit card images.

= 0.9 =
* Initial public release.
